This article is not a review or the conference, you can find better articles for that. I'm just using this platform to remember my takeaways and have a return point to what I've learned.

That said, dotSecurity was a really good surprise for the first edition of the little sister of dotScale: really good talks and really good rythm. Talks were not that technical and as promised, the security part was comprehensible for webdevs. And for my main takeway, a security conference is a place where a speacker will show how easy it is to break a server, enter as root and delete everything so you might want to always upgrade your stack to avoid having old vulnerabilites and make it easy to break your servers.

##Â Let's encrypt everywhere

First huge takeaway, let's encrypt has now became a mean for https everywhere. They have issued more than a million certificates for more than 2,4 million domains. I need to get on that even if this blog is just html pages.

##Â Multi factor auth

A really great talk about multi factor authentification with an emphasis on the drawbacks of each method that exists for the moment. There are differents ways for multi factor auth : SMS auth, app auth and physical token. Each of these has the same difficulty: what happens if you lose your tokens. If you want to have a multi factor auth, you will need to think about UX and cost, not really about security because - even if it's better - it's not full proof. Loosing a master key for physical tokens will force you to renew every token.

## Content Security Policy

I had no idea that this thing existed but it's really interesting. Content Security Policy or CSP is a header that your server can send with your pages that inform your browser on what resources are allowed on your site and how they are to be served (https or not). You can be as drastic as you want and allow just a whitelist of scripts to be executed. You can also deactivate all usage of inline scripts on your site and severely limit the cross scripting risks that go with it. The talks about CSP were largely a shout-out to this standard and I agree that it should be known and considered on every project.

The best thing is that you can just set this to be informative: it will just print warnings on the console to let you know what would happen if you enforced these policies. You could also use [report-uri.io](https://report-uri.io), a tool built by Scott Helme to build reporting around CSP.

You can find more about CSP on this article [Content Security Poliyc - an introduction](https://scotthelme.co.uk/content-security-policy-an-introduction/).

And to finish, a quote from Paul Mockapetris, Creator of the DNS:
