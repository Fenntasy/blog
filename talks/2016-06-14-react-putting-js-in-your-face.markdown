I gave this talk for a BBL (Brown Bag Lunch) at Axa Web Center, organized by [Cyril Lakech](https://twitter.com/cyril_lakech). The goal of the talk was to present React and its ecosystem (React-Router, Redux, MobX, ...)

## Errors I made

- Too. Many. Subjects. It was really hard to talk quickly about all that. I had one hour for this talk so I thought I could cram it all in but I had to talk quick and just fly over each subjects.

## What I think I did well

- The slides are reusable and the links in it are great.

- Using markdown-to-slides was really a boost to make so many slides in less than two days. The talk is just one markdown file and it's really easy to export it (and it makes a good way of preserving it). Incendently, code slides were readable.
