I gave this talk for the [Chti JS #15](http://chtijs.francejs.org/archives/2016-02-25/index.html), the Lille JS meetup community. The goal was to present React by going a little further than Hello Worlds or TodoList. It was between a talk about API architecture and Micro Services by [Nicolas Froidure](https://twitter.com/nfroidure) and a talk about Redux in React Native by [Mathieu Acthernoene](https://twitter.com/zoontek).

## Errors I made

- I didn't expect 800x600 video projector so code is sometimes cut (as you can see if you see the slides in the iframe). I need to work on that and show less code at once. Maybe with strange formatting. Maybe without boilerplates (imports, exports...).

- Talking loudly enough for about 30 people is hard for me and I was not prepared. There was no mic so I had to extend my voice way beyond usual and I'll have to work on that.

## What I thing I did well

- Overall, I think the talk went well: everybody seemed to understand the subject and I was just a few minutes late for the 20 minutes mark.
