For those who uses the video edition software <a title="kdenlive's website" href="http://www.kdenlive.org/" rel="nofollow">kdenlive</a>, if you encounter a __crash__ when opening a saved project or when you try to play it. You just have to go to your project folder (kdenlive in your home if you choose the default) and erase the .thumb directory in there. You can then reopen your project and all should be good again.
